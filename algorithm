Algorithm to display :

Step-1
Prepare our classes
Create three classes 
1.class card
2.class deck
3.class player

Step-2
Create class card
Card is going to take a suit and value self.and set its attributes suit ,value equal to whatever we pass in when we Create a card
Step-3
Make a string that print value and suit.
Step-4
Create our class card
Step-4.1-
Start with init method(initialise attribute cards with an empty list)
Step-4.2-
Create a loop that will loops suit through (“spades”,”clubs”,”diamonds”,”hearts”)
Step-4.3-
Create another loop that loop values in range (1,14)

Step-5
Append card (suit, value) to the self.cards list under second for loop, stop

Output:- 1-13 cards with suit displayed total 52 cards (4*13=52)!



Shuffling cards
Step-1
Use “import random” to use the “fisher Yates shuffle”
Step-2
Create a shuffle method that takes in self.
Step-2.1
Create a loop in this method ,for “i in range(len(self.cards)) minus 1(which is the last element and in this case we want to go to zero),0,-1decrement)”
step-2.2
Create a random number “r” call 
“r=random . ran dit (0,i)”.range from 0to I
Step-2.3
Pick a random index that is to the left of list.swap “i” and “r”
Step-3
Display the shuffled list.s

Draw method

Step-1
Create a draw card method that takes in self which will return self.cards.pop( )

Create player

Step-1
Create a draw method that takes in self and a deck in which we will pass in a deck
Step-2
Append a deck.draw cards( ) to the self.hand and return self for card drawn

Step-3
Create a show hand method to show the hand
Step-3.1
Create a for loop that will loop card in self.hand 
Step-3.2
Use card.show( ) to show our hand
